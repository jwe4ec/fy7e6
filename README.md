# fy7e6 - Web-Based Interpretation Bias Training to Reduce Anxiety: A Sequential, Multiple-Assignment Randomized Trial

This repository contains analysis code for this project on the Open Science Framework (OSF): [https://osf.io/fy7e6/](https://osf.io/fy7e6/).

## Data

This project imports intermediate clean data (**TODO: vX.X.X.X**) from the [Public Component](https://osf.io/s8v3h/) of the [MindTrails Calm Thinking Study project](https://osf.io/zbd52/) on OSF. These data were outputted from the study's centralized data cleaning, described on the [MT-Data-CalmThinkingStudy](https://github.com/TeachmanLab/MT-Data-CalmThinkingStudy) GitHub repo.

## Code

The imported data are considered intermediately cleaned because further analysis-specific cleaning is required for any given analysis. The present scripts perform this further cleaning and analyses for the manuscript, the main outcomes paper for the Calm Thinking study.
